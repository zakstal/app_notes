Go to the Sources tab and make sure the left-hand column is expanded. In the
left-hand column, select the Sources sub-tab.
You''ll see a tree of the resources from your page, organized by path. Navigate
 to the CSS file you want to edit (e.g. assets/users.css).
Right-click on the CSS file, and select Save As.... Navigate to the location
of the CSS file in your file system and save over it (don''t worry; it isn''t
really replacing anything yet.)
Double-click on the CSS file to open it in the Dev Tools editor and start
styling! Notice how the code you write immediately affects the page. This is
 why this is such an awesome way to code CSS. But don''t forget to save
 (command or control + s) to persist your work to disk.
Lastly, you may want to configure Chrome to use two-space indentation instead
of four. You can do this through the settings, accessible via the cog wheel in
  the top-right of the Dev Tools window.
